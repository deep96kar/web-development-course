What this folder contains
-------------------------
- Short exercises (01–19) with example source files to practice individual concepts.
- A long set of short video lessons grouped by topic — HTML basics, CSS fundamentals and layout, JavaScript concepts, plus introduction to backend and React topics.

How to use
---------
- For static examples, open the relevant `index.html` in your browser.
- For Node/Vite projects, run the following inside the project folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Suggested improvements
---------------------
- Add a `COURSE_INDEX.md` mapping the key video lessons to learning goals and difficulty (easy/medium/hard).
- Add one-line descriptions to each `exercise` folder (I can generate these automatically).

Would you like me to:
- Generate a `COURSE_INDEX.md` listing the most important videos and exercises?
- Add a short description file inside each `exercise` folder automatically?
